                            <!-- <div class="image fit"><img src="images/aboutmepicture.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->
								<p>I am a recent
                                    graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has curated my skills in becoming a well-rounded data
                                    scientist and sofware developer. I have received my Data Science certificate from the University after the completion of 15+ credit hours of courses
                                    that allowed me to apply my skills on various projects. I recently completed a Research Park Training programming
                                    during the summer where I strengthened my skills in python, Git/Github, and SQL.
                                    I believe that my unique background in computer science, statistical analysis and applied
                                    economics allows me to attack problems with an open mindset, that others with a more technical major would not be
                                    able to do. With a major in Economics and a minor in statistics, my educational background has provided me with an
                                    understanding of statistical analysis, from languages like R, Python and SQL, programming languages like Java and
                                    C++, and econometrics and quantitative reasoning. I have mastered my skills in these languages to be able to use
                                    techniques such as machine learning, data mining, data cleansing data visualization. My experience in software development has also helped me 
                                    gain skills such as, software testing, optimization, object oriented programing and further increased my critical thinking skills.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I have gained practical skills on various projects. For instance, I participated in the Illinois Datathon where I identified
                                        key attributes in a dataset of over 5 million observations of all zip codes in the United States to help a marketing team
                                        identify what areas they should target that would generate the most revenue with a limited budget. I was tasked with
                                        selecting which variables out of 60 would be useful to include in our model. I did so using stepwise selection tools in R
                                        and searching for different datasets that would add to my model. I have also worked with Python Developers at Blue Cross Blue Shield(Health Care Service Center)
                                        to update company applications in the claims department. In this role I also worked with developer to create a an app the HCSC will use in the future to target the youth and increase their overall health.
                                        Because of my experiences I believe that I would bring imense value to any position that I am placed in.
